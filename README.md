# Cricket-Modelling-Project
Code for my project predicting the 2019 WC


This is a major statistical-prediction project I'm working on ahead of the ICC (men's) Cricket World Cup in England starting on May 30. The aim---and I've already made major progress towards this end, thankfully---is to develop a sophisticated prediction model in an attempt to predict the World Cup (or, as a preliminary ambition, to predict some of the group-stage games). Very soon, I will commence getting up a website advertising my model and its predictions with some pretty graphics.

The process started a few months ago, beginning with a lot of scraping---in particular, several years worth of data on ODI cricket matches from Cricinfo, using its wonderful Statsguru searchable database (http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html), plus historic player rankings data from the old ICC rankings page (http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/), and data on historic team rankings obtained miscellaneously. This all involved several Python web-scraping scripts (see repository for code), and was at times rather painstaking. The harder part, though, was to integrate this data into a spreadsheet where each row is a match, with columns for both basic metadata (teams, data) and for the richer data-types I had harvested ((normalised) ranking, proxies for batting-strength and bowling-strength, win margin, plus some important categorical data: home/away/neutral, batfirst_day/batfirst_night/batsecond_day/batsecond_night). Eventually, I managed to put all the matches, with all the attendant data, in one nice .csv file (see repository).

Initially, I began with five years of data, then I expanded it out to 8 when I found that I couldn't get a satisfying logistic regression going (this may also have had to do with the encoding of my categorical variables, not that I understood this issue at the time). I may have time to add another two or three years, but there are also some advantages to recency and the sample size I have achieved is respectable enough.

At this stage, I have used a subset of the data I have collected (ignoring all the tied matches, and ignoring my margin of victory data) to do a logistic regression. This has allowed me not only to identify the relative strength of each of the general factors involved in deciding ODI match outcomes, but I now have my first prediction model also. On my test data, I've achieved a prediction-accuracy rate of 0.65, which I'm pretty happy with (though this result involves regression on a couple of variables that only come into play after the toss is known). In theory, I should be able to do better than that predicting games in just one environment (England), rather than generally, because I should be able to integrate the rate of success of team X in English conditions.

One subtle, interesting result of this process is that, at least if we can trust my proxies and sample size, a team's batting strength matters more than its bowling strength.... by quite a margin. It may suggest that good bowlers tend to have less of an outsize impact than good batsmen in ODI matches (see repository for more).

I am not sure if I'll have time to fit a model that deals with more than two outcomes (tie, small win/loss, moderate win/loss, big win/loss) before the World Cup begins. However, as I suggested, I will try to integrate England-specific data into the 'final model' somehow.
